# FG Filter

Fluid-o-tech FG20x/30x/40x gear pumps want a smooth control signal. PWM signals aren't. This is a really tiny board designed to fit into a Hammond 1551 project box allowing you to add an RC filter.

## Features

* Designed for terminal blocks and hand soldered caps and resistors
* Extra holes for adding zip ties as strain relief
